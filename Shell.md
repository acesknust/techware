Description:
The ```shell``` is a <b>Command Line Interpreter</b> which translates commands by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by a kernel.

The most common shell used is the Bash shell which stands for Bourne again shell written by Brian Fox and is compatible with the Bourne shell named after Stephen Bourne.
The bourne shell had two primary goals: serve as a command interpreter and for scripting.
Other shells include the C shell, Korn shell, TENEX C shell.
